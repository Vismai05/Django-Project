Created an E-commerce website using Django framework

For using this website you need to register yourself and create your login Id and password and then login using those credentials

You will not be able to access the site until you login because I have used @login_required decorator to protect the functions used for the site.

Home Page:

the dropdown itself.

happen neither the card details entered are saved in any module
